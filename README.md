**Lab Exercise 1 – Array Index and Bounds**
Objective: Understand array indices and out-of-bounds errors.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a program that declares an array of size 5.
2. Intentionally access an invalid index (e.g., list[5]).
3. Observe and record what happens when you run the program.
4. Modify your code to prevent accessing invalid indices.
5. Explain why C++ does not automatically check array bounds.

**Reflection:**
- How can array index errors cause unpredictable results?
- What are good programming practices to prevent them?
